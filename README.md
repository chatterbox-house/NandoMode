# NandoMode

A Spanish vocabulary trainer inspired by Fernando, a tall, blonde-haired, blue-eyed Spanish teacher, with a retro Japanese pixel art style and a nod to "nandomo" (‰ΩïÂ∫¶„ÇÇ, meaning "many times" in Japanese). Kids match emojis to Spanish words, with fun 8-bit graphics, chiptune sounds, and a festive end screen to keep learning engaging!

## About
- **Goal**: Help kids learn Spanish words by matching emojis (e.g., üçé) to words (e.g., "Manzana").
- **Features**:
  - Pixelated Japanese-style graphics (sprites, avatars, victory banner).
  - Golden boxes for correct matches, locked but playable for pronunciation.
  - Audio lock to prevent clicks during text-to-speech or sounds.
  - Festive end screen with "¬°Bien Hecho!", leaderboard, and play/finish options.
  - Toggleable chiptune background music.
- **Tech**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Web Audio API, and base64 assets.

## File Structure
To keep the project organized, we'll use multiple files:
